## 👋 Introduction

This repository contains the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) application running over at [gitfollow.com](https://gitfollow.com).

GitFollow is a tool that let's you check if a GitHub user follows another one and vice-versa.

## ❓ Why

I was curious and wanted to see if some people followed eachother, however, these people had too many followers to manually browse through.

Since GitHub doesn't provide a search feature for followers, this app was built.

It's essentially just an API call, with a beautiful UI built on top of it.

## 🚀 Development

- Clone the repository
- cd into the directory & execute **`npm install`**
- Run the app with **`npm run dev`**

## 📋 License

GitFollow is released under the MIT license.
